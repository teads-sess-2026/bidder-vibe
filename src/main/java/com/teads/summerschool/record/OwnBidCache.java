/**
 * In-memory record of this bidder's own recent bids (requestId -> creativeId/bidPrice).
 *
 * <p>AuctionNoticeConsumer.consume() runs on EVERY auction notice broadcast to EVERY
 * bidder, win or loss, whether or not we bid on it — that's most of the topic's volume.
 * Before this cache, the only way to know "did we bid on this one, and if so with what
 * creative/price" was a Postgres lookup by requestId, on every single message. Since we
 * already know that the moment we place a bid (see BiddingService.bid()), caching it in
 * memory turns that per-message DB round trip into an O(1) local lookup, and lets the
 * consumer skip everything else immediately for auctions we never bid on.
